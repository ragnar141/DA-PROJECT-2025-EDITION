Issued under royal authority, the laws reflect a stratified society where punishment varies by class, gender, and offense. They blend empirical regulation with religious taboos and were primarily accessed by the literate legal elite. The code represents one of the earliest Indo-European attempts to systematically order society through law.",

It ended the conflict following the Battle of Kadesh and established non-aggression, mutual defense, and extradition clauses. Written in both Egyptian (hieroglyphs) and Akkadian (cuneiform)—the diplomatic lingua franca of the time—the treaty reflects the political sophistication of Late Bronze Age diplomacy. While the Akkadian version is neutral, the Egyptian version portrays the treaty as a triumph of Ramesses. Both versions invoke divine witnesses to sacralize the peace.",
